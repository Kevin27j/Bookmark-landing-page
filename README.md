# Frontend Mentor - Bookmark landing page solution

I used mainly Javascript with JQuery and some Bootstrap for the buttons and small components.
This project helped me with reinforcing my Javascript and JQeury knowledge.

This is a solution to the [Bookmark landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/bookmark-landing-page-5d0b588a9edda32581d29158). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.
